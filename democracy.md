## Treaties
### ***"Keep voting until you vote YES"***

When is it democratic to repeat a referendum?
 * **Ireland Voted twice on Nice and Lisbon treaties**
 * Nice Treaty ([1st Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fourth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_Bill_2001), [2nd Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-sixth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland))
 * Lisbon Treaty ([1st Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-eighth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_Bill_2008), [2nd Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-eighth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland))


### **Breaking the spirit of Treaties with Technicalities** 
Energy Solidarity Contribution (September 2022)
* A tax euphemistically called a *contribution* to avoid legal challenges
* [Official Description](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_22_5490)
   * ""Establishing this **solidarity contribution** as a European instrument will ensure that negative spillovers within the internal energy market stemming from uncoordinated national measures can be avoided and **risks of litigation between companies and governments can be reduced** substantially.""
* This measure is also retrospective which sounds not great to me. Announced in September 2022 it applies to profits for 2022 which includes before the announcement.

Energy Price Cap (Winter 2022)
* To be confirmed I'm told this is also purposely not called a tax
* If it was officially called a *tax* it would require unanimous voting
* By calling it something else they only need qualified majority voting

## Sovereignty
### Sovereignty Encroachment
Also known as "Ever Closer Union".

Over time the EU is absorbing more sovereignty from member states, arguably without democratic votes on the individual issues. For example, when the EU issues a new directive it can take control of something which was previously done nationally. Over time more and more directives will be made and more and more things will fall into centralised EU sovereignty this way.

On the flip side, people often complain about governments, so the more sovereignty claimed by the EU the more people will complain about the EU.

### Irish Independance 
From the United Kingdom ~1922

All 7 signatories of the Irish Procalamation were executed in 1916:
* [See Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_the_Irish_Republic)
* What would they think of Ireland handing sovereignty to the European Union?

In their words:
> We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland.

They opposed:
> usurpation of that right by a foreign people and government

And proclaimed:
> the Irish Republic as a Sovereign Independant State

However:
* It's worth bearing in mind that EU membership isn't oppressive in the way that British Rule was
* Temper that too with a context where executions were more common. The Irish Free state subsequently executed rebels including [Robert Erskine Childers](https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2022/1122/1337715-robert-erskine-childers/)

## Accountability
*The EU Commission has no opposition*
* Contrast with US President who is held accountable by congress and at re-election
* Contrast with Irish government held accountable by the DÃ¡il opposition party
* The EU Parliament exists but it doesn't have a clear cut **opposition party**

### Constructive Criticism

Instead of being pro or anti-EU we need people who are pro-EU and critical because they want it to be even better.

For example
* Josep Borrell (EU Foreign Affairs Representative) [October 2022 Speech amidst the war in Ukraine](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/eu-ambassadors-annual-conference-2022-opening-speech-high-representative-josep-borrell_en)
