# Democracy

### *"Keep voting until you vote YES"*
When is it democratic to repeat a referendum?
 * **Ireland Voted twice on Nice and Lisbon treaties**
 * Nice Treaty ([1st Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fourth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_Bill_2001), [2nd Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-sixth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland))
 * Lisbon Treaty ([1st Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-eighth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_Bill_2008), [2nd Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-eighth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland))


## Sovereignty
### Sovereignty Encroachment
Also known as "Ever Closer Union".

Over time the EU is absorbing more sovereignty from member states, arguably without democratic votes on the individual issues. For example, when the EU issues a new directive it can take control of something which was previously done nationally. Over time more and more directives will be made and more and more things will fall into centralised EU sovereignty this way.

On the flip side, people often complain about governments, so the more sovereignty claimed by the EU the more people will complain about the EU.

### Irish Independance 
From the United Kingdom ~1922

All 7 signatories of the Irish Procalamation were executed in 1916:
* [See Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_the_Irish_Republic)
* What would they think of Ireland handing sovereignty to the European Union?

In their words:
> We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland.

They opposed:
> usurpation of that right by a foreign people and government

And proclaimed:
> the Irish Republic as a Sovereign Independant State
