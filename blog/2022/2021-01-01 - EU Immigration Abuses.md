# EU Immigration Abuses
Today is January 1st 2022. I am writing (and shocked) after talking with a friend who spent time on the Croatia-Bosnia border trying to help refugees.

The following concerns were raised:
* Border security **beating up migrants**
* Border security **stealing the belongings of migrants**

The motivation is not fully clear although it's possibly done to deter migrants.

What can we do?
1. Political pressure to **stop human rights violations**
2. Countries should **stop funding** these violations
     * e.g. via [Frontex](https://frontex.europa.eu/) the EU border control agency.
