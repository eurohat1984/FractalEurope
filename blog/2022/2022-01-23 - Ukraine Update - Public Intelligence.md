Quick blog post about US sharing public intelligence on developments in the Ukraine: [FT: US intelligence-sharing convinces allies of Russian threat to Ukraine](https://www.ft.com/content/b287f2e3-3b8b-4095-b704-c255a943c84c)

Quick comments:
* Europe hasn't done a good job responding to Russian threats in the Ukraine (first Crimea, now the 2021 troop deployment situation).
* USA has an interesting strategy of sharing intelligence information publicly. This could help spur on European action (eventually) via greater public awareness.

What should Europe do:
1. I'm not sure but it needs to figure out a good strategy for dealing with Russia
2. It should reduce reliance on Russian gas
    * Increase LNG imports
    * Cut back on climate goals in the short term?
        * Increase nuclear, reduce decommissioning of non-gas power plants
    * This would be the first in a two step of getting independant so the EU is in a better position to take actions without being hit hard by cuts to gas
3. Increase military spending
    * Europe relies on the USA for defence. This isn't a good arrangement. USA shouldn't do so much abroad and Europe pverall should at least have defence capabilities like or better than Switzerland, for example.
