# Migrant Abuse in Europe
I am writing (and shocked) after talking with a friend who spent time on the Croatia-Bosnia border trying to help refugees.

The following concerns were raised:
* Border security **violence against migrants**
* Border security **taking belongings from migrants**

The motivation is not fully clear (why would anybody do such things?). A mindset of deterance is probably part of it.

What can we do?
1. Political pressure to **stop human rights violations** againt migrants.
2. Better **due dillegence when financing border control** by other countries
    * e.g. via [Frontex](https://frontex.europa.eu/) the EU border control agency.
