### International Benchmarking
Some EU strengths when benchmarked internationally:
* Democracy
* Legal System
* Human rights

On the above the EU performs well compared to other large blocks such as
* Brasil, Russia, India, China

There's still room to improve. I think Switzerland has stronger democracy. But just being compared to Switzerland is a sign that things are not too bad. 

# Relations with Superpowers
The EU can do more to avoid manipulation by superpowers.

Three levels to think about:
1. Direct manipulation
2. Leverage for blackmail
3. Leverage held by a country you don't trust

### Case Study: Energy Dependancy
In 2021 Russia is using EU gas supply as a geopolitical tool.

For example:
* [Nord Stream Pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nord_Stream#Political_aspects)
    * The EU is torn between approving a pipeline for gas
    * And protecting members/neighbours from geopolitical manipulation.
* [Russian troops on Ukraine border (2021)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/energy-crisis-in-europe-intensifies-with-russian-troops-on-ukraine-border-11639581725)
    * Any dissuasive actions by the EU risk retaliation affecting energy supply

Solution:
* Reduce dependancy on Russian Gas
    * LNG shipments from other countries
    * Reduce dependancy on gas for power grid stability
* Unite with the like-minded non-EU members such as the United Kingdom for a more effective response

### Other
* Manufactured Goods e.g. China
* Software e.g. USA

# Relations with Smaller Nations

### Barriers to Trade
The EU Single Market acts as a barrier to trade with non-members.

##### Trade Equality
* Poorer nations

### Brexit
A quick summary of Brexit Negotiations
1. Larger entities have more negotiating power
2. Without Northern Ireland, the UK would be very weak in negotiations
    * `EU > UK`
    * `UK > Ireland`
