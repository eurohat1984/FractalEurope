### International Benchmarking
Some EU strengths when benchmarked internationally:
* Democracy
* Legal System
* Human rights

On the above the EU performs well compared to other large blocks such as
* Brasil, Russia, India, China

There's still room to improve. I think Switzerland has stronger democracy. But just being compared to Switzerland is a sign that things are not too bad. 

### Barriers to Trade
The EU Single Market acts as a barrier to trade with non-members.

##### Trade Equality
* Poorer nations

### Brexit
A quick summary of Brexit Negotiations
1. Larger entities have more negotiating power
2. Without Northern Ireland, the UK would be very week in negotiations
    * `EU > UK`
    * `UK > Ireland`
