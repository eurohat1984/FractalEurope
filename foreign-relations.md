# Immigration
Human Rights Abuses
* See [this blog article](/blog/2022/2021-01-01%20-%20EU%20Immigration%20Abuses.md) from January 2022.
    * Alleged abuses by security personnel funded and organised by the EU.

# International Benchmarking
Some EU strengths when benchmarked internationally:
* Democracy
* Legal System
* Human rights

On the above the EU performs well compared to other large blocks such as
* Brasil, Russia, India, China

There's still room to improve. I think Switzerland has stronger democracy. But just being compared to Switzerland is a sign that things are not too bad. 

# Relations with Superpowers
The EU can do more to avoid manipulation by superpowers.

Three levels to think about:
1. Direct manipulation
2. Leverage for blackmail
3. Leverage held by a country you don't trust

### Case Study - Energy Dependancy
In 2021 Russia is using EU gas supply as a geopolitical tool.

For example:
* [Nord Stream Pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nord_Stream#Political_aspects)
    * The EU is torn between approving a pipeline for gas
    * And protecting members/neighbours from geopolitical manipulation.
* [Russian troops on Ukraine border (2021)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/energy-crisis-in-europe-intensifies-with-russian-troops-on-ukraine-border-11639581725)
    * Any dissuasive actions by the EU risk retaliation affecting energy supply

Solution:
* Reduce dependancy on Russian Gas
    * LNG shipments from other countries
    * Reduce dependancy on gas for power grid stability
* Unite with the like-minded non-EU members such as the United Kingdom for a more effective response

### Other
* Manufactured Goods e.g. China
* Software e.g. USA

# Relations with Smaller Nations

### Barriers to Trade
The EU Single Market acts as a barrier to trade with non-members.

##### Trade Equality
* Poorer nations

## Brexit
A quick summary of Brexit Negotiations
1. Larger entities have more negotiating power
2. Without Northern Ireland, the UK would be very weak in negotiations
    * `EU > UK`
    * `UK > Ireland`

##### Northern Ireland Protocol
Also known as Article 16. Here are two speeches delivered directly by the chief Negotiators in October 2021:
* UK: [David Frost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ULASuL3PGs)
* EU: [Maroš Šefčovič](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJU_3SDqyLs)

##### Brexit one year on:
**Customs Frictions** (Duties and checks)
* Goods
  1. EU
     * e.g. people in Ireland get hit when ordering from Amazon
     * Applied to UK exports starting 2021
     * Imports expected to follow in 2022
  2. Northern Ireland
     * **Checks within the UK** when entering Northern Ireland add friction for businesses
* Frictions & paperwork especially hard on small businesses for whom it's not always worth the effort 

**Immigration Frictions**
* More tedious travel requirements
* Visas required for working
    * EU people now need same visas as rest of world
    * Skilled worker visa requirements are more open than before

**Driver Shortages**
  * Moreso than seen in the EU
  * A good thing for drivers, who can get good hiring conditions

**Covid**
* Difficult to untangle Brexit from covid effects
* Covid surely has much more impact on people (2020 & 2021) than Brexit
    * e.g. inflation is global, any Brexit inflation is probably noise by comparison

**Relations**
Foreign Relations
* Strained relations between EU/Irish politicians and Brexit team trying to renegotiate Article 16 on Northern Ireland
    * EU/Irish politicians emotively frustrated by things
* Ongoing nagging between UK & France
    * Fishing Rights
        * Treats to cut island electricity supply from France.
    * Suspected Brexit motive behind covid travel restrictions on the UK at times e.g. December 2021. 

Public Opinion in the UK
* Seems very split and polarising
* British people often are very pro or very anti Brexit.

Other Notes:
* Gibraltar
