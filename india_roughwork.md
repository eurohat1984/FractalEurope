2023-09 Renaming India to Bharat
* Modi sat behind a nameplate saying *Bharat* at the G20 in India in 2023.
* **The first line of the constitution says: *India, also known as Bharat, is a Union of States.***
* **Bharat name is derived from Sanskrit and variations are used in most Indian languages.**
* Much like how the Irish constitution says: *The name of the State is Éire, or, in the English language, Ireland.* although in the Indian case precedence is given to the English version and this would need 2/3 parlimentary majority to change.
* **The BJP’s preference for Bharat reflects a deep resentment of colonial rule** and desire to emphasise this resentment, potentially using it for political advantage in international negotiations and to rile up political support domestically.
