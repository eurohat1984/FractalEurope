### Summary
*Good Intentions, Bad Implementation*

### Cookie Banners
* Achieve the **opposite effect**
* The intention is to protect people's privacy
* The effect is that people click "Accept All"
* An alternative solution would have **browsers where people can set their preferences once and stop wasting time** each time they visit a new website.
* Even people outside the EU end up wasting time with cookie banners when websites implement them globally rather than tailoring to the EU
