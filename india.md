## International Bullying
See my blog on the European Union for views on the bullying of smaller political groups by larger ones.

2023 Sikh Activist Murder in Canada
* Canadian PM Trudeau said that there is a potential link with the government of India based on his security sources
* Rather than cooperating with an investigation India retaliated like a bully and stopped issuing visas, expelled diplomats, retaliated by saying Canada shouldn't have more diplomats in India than India has in Canada etc.
* India reiterated that it is concerned about Khalistani extremists in Canada (this doesn't exactly help their case that they want people to believe they are not involved)
* [Hindustan Times: Trudeau 'Complains' Against India During Talks With World Leaders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZouC4QiCHE)
* [Financial Times: Ottawa attempts to mend rift with New Delhi over murder of Sikh separatist](https://www.ft.com/content/146b4e53-07aa-4cc0-9ed7-064532fbb39c)
* [Nijjar Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardeep_Singh_Nijjar#Allegation_of_Indian_responsibility)
* Interestingly a bunch of twitter memes went around indian media outlets mocking Trudeau. Various fictional stories that end in *'We also spoke about India'*. The lack of a good punch line makes me suspect this is pushed by the Modi/BJP IT army moreso than naturally shared.

## Corruption
Context
* BJP was initially elected on an *anti-corruption* mandate, voting out the longstanding Congress party
* India suffers widely from corruption and this will be the case no matter who is in government, at least initially (legal system, police, ...)
* One can presume that any successful politician and business person has "navigated" this to some greater or lesser extent
* It's distinctly different from corruption in the UK, France, Switzerland where overt corruption is rare day-to-day and there is a there is fear of being called out (by the media / reported to superiors / whistleblowing )
