## Successes
Successes of Modi and the BJP government:
* Initially elected on an *anti-corruption* mandate, voting out the longstanding Congress party
* **Presided over successes in technology**
    * Government payment systems such as [UPI Pay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Payments_Interface), which cuts out the middle man in bank transactions
    * Private technology such as tech giants and start ups
* Confidence on the world stage
    * Modi has a greater an air of confidence on the world stage than predecessors
    * For many he offers an uplifting vision of *India*, much like how the national Cricket team does.

*\*\* I caveat this with the concern that it is a Hindu centric, uniformist vision. It is also a *confidence* reminiscent of Putin's Russia in earlier days. See [Putin's Big Praise For 'Mighty Indian Nation' Under PM Modi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ai_lAtDQrw) (October 2023)*

## Alledged Crimes
These murders, attempted murders and legal cases show an uncanny resemblance with Putin's Russia (Think poisonings in the UK, Kangaroo Courts).

## Criticism
### Suppression of Journalists
About suppression, threats, violance, intimidation etc. against journalists critical of the government. 

**This is one of the most clear cut criticisms of Modi and the BJP.** As of 2023 all the main media organisations have become pro Modi. For example, check out the Hindustan Times on Youtube. The once balanced publication has become a sensationalist pro-government outlet. 

2023-10 **NewsClick Raid** on Government Critics:
* [BBC Article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66909370): `NewsClick: India police arrest journalists over China funding claims`
* Government critics arrested
* *A case was reportedly registered against the website under UAPA, a draconian anti-terror law that makes it nearly impossible to get bail.*

2023-02 **Raid on BBC Offices** in response to Modi Documentary
* *What is the BBC Modi documentary and why is it so controversial?*
* [The Guardian 2023-02-14](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/14/why-is-bbc-report-on-narendra-modis-handling-of-sectarian-riots-in-2002-so-controversial)
* *BBC India offices searched by income tax officials*
* [BBC 2023-02-14](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64634711.amp)

2023 Bad Ranking for Press Freedom
* [Reporters Without Borders](https://rsf.org/en/country/india)
* 161 out of 180 countries 
* I know Indians like to get full marks but approaching 180/180 is a bad sign under this metric!

**Suppression of Kashmiri Media**
* [2023-03 New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/opinion/india-kashmir-modi-media-censorship.html)

### Political Suppression
**Disqualification of Opposition Leader from Parliament**
* *Indian court orders Rahul Gandhi to two years in jail for Modi comment*
* Opposition party leader Rahul Gandhi was convicted of *defaming all people with the Modi surname*
* The conviction disqualified Gandhi as a member of parliament
* As of August 2023 he has the conviction stayed by the Supreme Court of India pending appeal

   * [Wikipedia: Disqualificatino of Rahul Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqualification_of_Rahul_Gandhi)

### Regional Suppression
2019 Revocation of Kashmiri Autonomy
* *In 2019, Mr. Modi’s government abruptly revoked Kashmir’s autonomous status without public input from the territory’s people, sent in thousands of troops and shut down internet access.*
* [Wiki: Revocation of Special Status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revocation_of_the_special_status_of_Jammu_and_Kashmir)
* [Wiki: Kashmir Lockdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932021_Jammu_and_Kashmir_lockdown)

### Internet Blackouts
* [2023-09 Guardian Article:](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/25/a-tool-of-political-control-how-india-became-the-world-leader-in-internet-blackouts): **How India became the world leader in internet blackouts**

### International Bullying
See my blog on the European Union for views on the bullying of smaller political groups by larger ones.

2023 Sikh Activist Murder in Canada
* Canadian PM Trudeau informed his parliament that there is a potential link with the government of India based on his security sources
* **Rather than cooperating with an investigation India retaliated**. For example India stopped issuing visas to Canadians and expelled diplomats. It declared that Canada shouldn't have more diplomats in India than India has in Canada.
* India reiterated that it is concerned about Khalistani extremists in Canada (**this doesn't exactly help their case that they are uninvolved**). India has for years been making requests to the Canadian government about what it considers extremist elements in Canada.
* Links:
    * [Financial Times: Ottawa attempts to mend rift with New Delhi over murder of Sikh separatist](https://www.ft.com/content/146b4e53-07aa-4cc0-9ed7-064532fbb39c)
    * [Hindustan Times: Trudeau 'Complains' Against India During Talks With World Leaders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZouC4QiCHE). Interesting how Hindustan Times chooses to portray this... 
    * [Nijjar Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardeep_Singh_Nijjar#Allegation_of_Indian_responsibility)
* Interestingly a bunch of twitter memes went around Indian media outlets mocking Trudeau. Various fictional stories that end in *'We also spoke about India'*. The lack of a good punch line makes me suspect this is pushed by the Modi/BJP IT army moreso than naturally shared.

2023 BBC Documentary and British PM Sunak
* With so much of his family and wealth tied to India, PM Sunak is in a weak position to criticise the Modi Government (What if they find tax allegations like they did with the BBC)
* Sunak is limited to the meek statements like *"we do not tolerate persecution anywhere"*
* And depending how you read between the lines he tries to console Modi with vagueries such as *I am not sure that I agree at all with the characterisation [of Modi]*.

### Corruption
Context
* India suffers widely from corruption and this will be the case no matter who is in government, at least initially (legal system, police, ...)
* One can presume that any successful politician and business person has "navigated" this to some greater or lesser extent
* It's distinctly different from corruption in the UK, France, Switzerland where overt corruption is rare day-to-day and there is a there is a fear of being called out (by the media / reported to superiors / whistleblowing )
* In contrast with the Congress party, the **BJP is both corrupt *and* cunning** instead of just corrupt (see [deflection tactics](deflection-tactics) section below)
* Ironically the BJP was initially elected on an *anti-corruption* mandate, replacing the longstanding Congress party

2023-03 Adani Allegations
* In January 2023, Hindenburg Research published the findings of a two-year investigation alleging that Adani had engaged in market manipulation and accounting malpractices. Link: [Wikipedia: Adani Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adani_Group#Stock_manipulation_and_accounting_fraud_allegations)
* *Adani is widely regarded as being close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and has publicly aligned his business with the government’s growth agenda.*
* [Financial Times 2023-03-02](https://www.ft.com/content/578df2dc-71d7-4ca3-aaff-7db4d52a38fc): India’s Supreme Court probe of Adani allegations
* Adani's 2022 takeover of NDTV media outlet is also concerning, adding it to a list of outlets such as Hindustan Times which are now biased in favour of Modi and the BJP. Critical reporting has been pushed to more informal whatsapp channels etc. amid a clearout of critics in the major Indian media institutions.

### Silence on Atrocities
Manipur Violence 2023
* *Prime Minister Narendra Modi had remained silent on the violence in Manipur up until the video of the 4 May 2023*
* [20 July 2023  BBC Article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66260730): Manipur violence: What is happening and why

Gujarat Riots 2002
* Juring Modi's time as chief minister

## Deflection Tactics
For Context: Putin's Kremlin is the master of all deflection tactics. With twisted language such as *invasion* -> "special operation" they have shown us all the benefit of documenting deflection tactics into categories so they can be more readily responded to.

1. **Labelling criticism of Modi as "anti-India"** and "colonial":
    * For example, the BJP response to the BBC's Modi Documentary
    * As if to say that Modi=India => criticism of Modi is...
2. Acusing groups you don't like of **"foreign influence"**
    * For example, when the police raided NewsClick they accused it of being a Chinese propoganda outlet
3. Accuse countries of *harbouring terrorists*
    * For example, 2023 Sikh Activist Murder in Canada (see above)
    * Copied from the Turkish playbook in NATO Negotiations: [*Sweden will not get Turkey's nod for NATO bid unless it stops sheltering 'terrorists,'*](https://www.reuters.com/world/sweden-will-not-get-turkeys-nod-nato-bid-unless-it-stops-sheltering-terrorists-2023-07-03/)
4. Fall Guys
    * **Modi is portrayed with a God like stature** and never responsible for anything that happens (see section above about about [*silence on atrocities*](#silence-on-atrocities))
    * At best when BJP is responsible for something there is a fall guy, someone lower down who takes the blame
  
Other
* Taking advantage of Social deference
    * Indian culture extends respect to certain people such as Elders, Spiritual Leaders and Superiors.
    * This can go overboard and be used to silence comment and criticism (For example, in Indian courts senior lawyers are listened to more and junior ones get dismissed more abruptly.)
    * In Modi's case for example, omitting use of the the *Ji* (जी) honorific (as in *Modi Ji*) has become a sign of disrespect.
    * Critics feel pressured to use it! (Mainly applies to political critics as of 2023 because the press is no longer free.)
    * Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi is rarely referred to as *Gandhi Ji* (that title is reserved for his namesake, Mahatma Gandhi).

# Recommendations
1. **Regular changes of the governing party**
   * This limits how much one party from entrench itself
   * I emphasise this as being particularly important because of the status of government suppression in media and the judiciary
   * Even if the two major parties both have problems, a regular changeover can help prevent and overturn concerning developments, even if just to overturn them in the favour of the other party
   * This need could be relaxed if the governing party starts acting responsibly. Read freer media, stronger institutions and separation of powers (e.g. judicial, and also for the central bank)

2. **Decentralisation of Power**
   * Deal with things as locally as possible (Switzerland style)
   * This limits the power of any one person or group at the top
   * It also allows for local diversity of preferences

3. **Term Limits**
   * Same as point 1) but this can be hardcoded in the rules

# External Links
### BBC Documentary
I highly recommend the **BBC Documentary** [*India: The Modi Question*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India:_The_Modi_Question)
* Explores Modi's past and connection to riots in Gujarat (2002)
* The **Modi Government has banned the documentary** from being screened, describing it as "hostile propaganda and anti-India garbage"
* Tax officials raided BBC India Offices after Modi Documentary release. See [Suppression of Journalists](#suppression-of-journalists) section above.
