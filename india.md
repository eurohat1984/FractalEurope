### Successes
Successes of Modi and the BJP government:
* Initially elected on an *anti-corruption* mandate, voting out the longstanding Congress party
* Presided over successes in technology
    * Government payment systems such as [UPI Pay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Payments_Interface), which cuts out the middle man in bank transactions
    * Private technology such as tech giants and start ups

### Criticism
#### Suppression of Journalists
About suppression, threats, violance, intimidation etc. against journalists critical of the government

2023-10 **NewsClick Raid** on Government Critics:
* [BBC Article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66909370): `NewsClick: India police arrest journalists over China funding claims`
* Government critics arrested
* *A case was reportedly registered against the website under UAPA, a draconian anti-terror law that makes it nearly impossible to get bail.*

2023-02 **Raid on BBC Offices** in response to Modi Documentary
* *What is the BBC Modi documentary and why is it so controversial?*
* [The Guardian 2023-02-14](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/14/why-is-bbc-report-on-narendra-modis-handling-of-sectarian-riots-in-2002-so-controversial)
* *BBC India offices searched by income tax officials*
* [BBC 2023-02-14](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64634711.amp)

2023 Bad Ranking for Press Freedom
* [Reporters Without Borders](https://rsf.org/en/country/india)
* 161 out of 180 countries 
* I know Indians like to get full marks but approaching 180/180 is a bad sign under this metric!

**Suppression of Kashmiri Media**
* [2023-03 New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/opinion/india-kashmir-modi-media-censorship.html)

#### Political Suppression
**Disqualification of Opposition Leader from Parliament**
* *Indian court orders Rahul Gandhi to two years in jail for Modi comment*
* Opposition party leader Rahul Gandhi was convicted of *defaming all people with the Modi surname*
* The conviction disqualified Gandhi as a member of parliament
* As of August 2023 he has the conviction stayed by the Supreme Court of India pending appeal

#### Regional Suppression
2019 Revocation of Kashmiri Autonomy
* *In 2019, Mr. Modi’s government abruptly revoked Kashmir’s autonomous status without public input from the territory’s people, sent in thousands of troops and shut down internet access.*

#### International Bullying
See my blog on the European Union for views on the bullying of smaller political groups by larger ones.

2023 Sikh Activist Murder in Canada
* Canadian PM Trudeau said that there is a potential link with the government of India based on his security sources
* Rather than cooperating with an investigation India retaliated and stopped issuing visas, expelled diplomats, retaliated by saying Canada shouldn't have more diplomats in India than India has in Canada etc.
* India reiterated that it is concerned about Khalistani extremists in Canada (this doesn't exactly help their case that they want people to believe they are not involved)
* [Financial Times: Ottawa attempts to mend rift with New Delhi over murder of Sikh separatist](https://www.ft.com/content/146b4e53-07aa-4cc0-9ed7-064532fbb39c)
* [Hindustan Times: Trudeau 'Complains' Against India During Talks With World Leaders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZouC4QiCHE). Interesting how Hindustan Times chooses to portray this... 
* [Nijjar Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardeep_Singh_Nijjar#Allegation_of_Indian_responsibility)
* Interestingly a bunch of twitter memes went around Indian media outlets mocking Trudeau. Various fictional stories that end in *'We also spoke about India'*. The lack of a good punch line makes me suspect this is pushed by the Modi/BJP IT army moreso than naturally shared.

#### Corruption
Context
* BJP was initially elected on an *anti-corruption* mandate, voting out the longstanding Congress party
* India suffers widely from corruption and this will be the case no matter who is in government, at least initially (legal system, police, ...)
* One can presume that any successful politician and business person has "navigated" this to some greater or lesser extent
* It's distinctly different from corruption in the UK, France, Switzerland where overt corruption is rare day-to-day and there is a there is a fear of being called out (by the media / reported to superiors / whistleblowing )

2023-03 Adani Allegations
* *Adani is widely regarded as being close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and has publicly aligned his business with the government’s growth agenda.*
* [Financial Times 2023-03-02](https://www.ft.com/content/578df2dc-71d7-4ca3-aaff-7db4d52a38fc) 
* Adani's 2022 takeover of NDTV media outlet is also concerning, adding it to a list of outlets such as Hindustan Times which are now biased in favour of Modi and the BJP. Critical reporting has been pushed to more informal whatsapp channels etc. amid a clearout of critics in the major Indian media institutions.

#### Silence on Atrocities
Manipur Violence
* *Prime Minister Narendra Modi had remained silent on the violence in Manipur up until the video of the 4 May 2023*
* [20 July 2023: BBC Manipur violence: What is happening and why](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66260730)

Gujarat Riots 2002
* Juring Modi's time as chief minister

### Deflection Tactics
For Context: Putin's Kremlin is the master of all deflection tactics. With twisted language such as *invasion* -> "special operation" they have shown us all the benefit of documenting deflection tactics into categories so they can be more readily responded to.

1. **Labelling criticism of Modi as "anti-India"** and "colonial":
    * For example, the BJP response to the BBC's Modi Documentary
    * As if to say that Modi=India => criticism of Modi is...
2. Acusing groups you don't like of **"foreign influence"**
    * For example, when the police raided NewsClick they accused it of being a Chinese propoganda outlet
3. Accuse countries of *harbouring terrorists*
    * For example, 2023 Sikh Activist Murder in Canada (see above)
    * Copied from the Turkish playbook in NATO Negotiations: [*Sweden will not get Turkey's nod for NATO bid unless it stops sheltering 'terrorists,'*](https://www.reuters.com/world/sweden-will-not-get-turkeys-nod-nato-bid-unless-it-stops-sheltering-terrorists-2023-07-03/)
4. Fall Guys
    * **Modi is portrayed with a God like stature** and never responsible for anything that happens (see section about about *silence on atrocities*)
    * Omitting use of the the *Ji* (जी) honorific (as in *Modi Ji*) has become a sign in itself of disrespect. Even critics feel pressured to use it! Rahul Gandhi was rarely referred to as *Gandhi Ji* (that title is reserved for his namesake, Mahatma Gandhi).
    * Modi's image is widespread, reminiscent of Mao, on Trains Seats, Billboards, Government brochures
    * At best when BJP is responsible for something there is a fall guy, someone lower down who takes the blame
