## International Bullying
See my blog on the European Union for views on the bullying of smaller political groups by larger ones.

2023 Sikh Activist Murder in Canada
* Canadian PM Trudeau said that there is a potential link with the government of India based on his security sources
* Rather than cooperating with an investigation India retaliated like a bully and stopped issuing visas, expelled diplomats, retaliated by saying Canada shouldn't have more diplomats in India than India has in Canada etc.
* India reiterated that it is concerned about Khalistani extremists in Canada (this doesn't exactly help their case that they want people to believe they are not involved)
* [Hindustan Times: Trudeau 'Complains' Against India During Talks With World Leaders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZouC4QiCHE)
