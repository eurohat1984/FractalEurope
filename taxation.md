# Corporate Tax
### Ireland
Rough Notes:
* French perception of unfairness about Ireland's 12.5% corporate tax rate
* And argument that EU funds helped Ireland grow, so Ireland in return should give in to pressure to increase corporate tax

##### Facebook Example
Claims that facebook pays too little tax in Ireland

Recommendation
* Facebook should pay **less** tax in Ireland because it doesn't do that much business there (add revenue, employees, ...)
* Countries complaining (e.g. France) about Irish tax are the ones failing to tax facebook
  * If their claims are so substantiated about Facebook presence then they should tax Facebook to the amount they see fit (e.g. based on advertising revenue)
* If EU rules block changes the EU should change rules so that countries can tax based on presence (sales / advertising / staff count). And maybe corporate tax isn't the right mechanism. Maybe income or vat is better but that's another story.
