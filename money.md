##### Strings Attached
EU funding generally has strings attached. I find this overly technocratic. In some cases this encourages member states to spend the money well. But overall I think member states should decide for themselves how to spend money. If the EU makes decisions centrally I think it leads to less variation, so less benefits from trial-and-error, and less locally tailored solutions.

    1. The EU decides what things the money can be spent on
    2. The EU makes the money conditional on specific reforms in the receiving member state
