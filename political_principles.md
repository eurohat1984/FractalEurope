# Debt
**Break the Taboo on Defaulting**
* Examples
    * Croydon Council in London
        * They are defacto bankrupt after doing silly property bets amongst other things
        * They should be allowed to default and start with a clean slate
        * Really **it's the lenders who should take the hit for lending the money out**, not the residents of croydon
        * **Sure the future borrowing costs might be higher**
        * **But that's fine, it'll incentive them to not borrow**, and balance the books
        * Currently in 2023 it looks like the council will have years of "balanced books" but still not escape its debt burden, that's even worse!
        * Croydon's impact should be just the cost that it will no longer be able to borrow at cheap rates,
        * but that's probably a good thing to discourage borrowing by an organisation that's can't manage debt!
        * Impact includes much scalled back grass cutting in parks
        * Less investment in amenities such as playgrounds etc
    * Similar story for people who go into massive debt
        * especially those with low income
        * it's really silly that the lender lent out the money in the first place
        * gov should make it easy for people to wipe the slate
        * these are people who will struggle if it's not easy to do
